I am a fourth year undergraduate student in Engineering Science, Robotics Major at the University of Toronto. I am currently working with [Roger Grosse](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/) on machine learning for automated reasoning at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).

During my undergraduate study, I have worked on Lipschitz-constrained convolutional network with [Roger Grosse](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/) and [JÃ¶rn-Henrik Jacobsen](https://jhjacobsen.github.io/). I also worked on unsupervised musical timbre transfer with [Roger Grosse](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/) and [Sageev Oore](http://www.cs.smu.ca/~sageev/). I was a summer research student in [Dynamic Systems Lab](http://www.dynsyslab.org/vision-news/) where I worked on machine learning for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control and distributed robot controls with [Angela Schoellig](http://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/).
